# nomo

Nomo is a standard for constructing identifiers that are unique, semantic, and mechanically easy to process. 

Nomo describes identifiers that are not bound to any institutional or mechanical infrastructure, nor to any central authority. Its purpose is to facilitate systematic cooperation and distributed recordkeeping by providing a stable framework for producing and consuming identifiers that are mutually intelligible and stable across many cultures and contexts, over arbitrarily short or long time spans.
